# Moodify – Music Recommendation Based on Mood

## Project Overview

Moodify is a web application that recommends songs tailored to the user’s current mood. By selecting their mood from a predefined list, such as Happy, Sad, Energetic, and Relaxed, users receive personalized playlists that enhance their emotional experience. The goal of the project is to merge basic user interaction with enjoyable music recommendations, making it both a creative and engaging platform.

## Key Features

### Mood-Based Music Recommendations

- Users can select their mood from a predefined list of options.
- Each mood category is associated with a curated playlist designed to match the emotional tone.
- The recommendation engine can use a simple music API to fetch songs or rely on a static list of tracks.

### Interactive Mood Selection Interface

- The interface includes icons for each mood, making the selection process intuitive and visually appealing.
- The mood selection process is designed to be simple and user-friendly, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Playlist Generation

- The application generates playlists based on the user’s selected mood.
- Playlists can be dynamically generated using a music API that provides access to a wide range of songs.
- Alternatively, static playlists curated by the developers can be used.

### Responsive Design

- The web application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- The layout adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining usability and aesthetic appeal.
